NOTICE: This mod requires a Character Creator extender in order to play as one of the new races. Other content is still available without an extender. 


The Elithian Races Mod is a massive expansion for Starbound which adds four new playable races along with hundreds of new items, objects, weapons, armour pieces and much more! All races have their own crafting progression, unique weapons and tiered armour, randomly generated settlements and anything else you'd expect from a new Starbound race. Quality is extremely important to me, and so the mod is incredibly polished, and everything you find in this mod will feel like a natural part of the game.

This mod aims to provide new content for every type of player - even if you don't like playing as custom races, you'll get a lot of value out of this mod! All decorative objects, weapons, vehicles, quests etc. are available to players of all races! The mod also includes dozens of collectable Unique Weapons, each of which has its own unique traits and abilities to spice up your gun- and swordplay. Explore new locations and visit two new outposts filled with quests, merchants and hidden secrets!



The four new playable races added by this mod are:











Elithian Races adds multiple new outposts for you to explore! These locations are filled with quests, merchants and hidden secrets for you to find, and act as the central hubs for much of the mod's content:







Besides the new playable races, the mod adds a massive amount of new content to the game, all of which you can enjoy even when not playing as one of the Elithian races. Here's a small selection of the vast amount of content available:

-Several new monsters to fight, capture and collect
-New crops to harvest, and food items to prepare
-A new rarity for items and equipment, Unique, for items of an even higher quality than Legendary
