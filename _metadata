  "description" : "DISCLAIMER: Back up your save files before installing. Characters and other save data, including ships and worlds, may be lost if the mod is uninstalled, so always keep a back-up! \n\nNOTICE: This mod requires a Character Creator extender in order to play as one of the new races. Other content is still available without an extender. \n\n=======================================\nELITHIAN RACES MOD\n=======================================\nThe Elithian Races Mod is a massive expansion for Starbound which adds three new playable races, along with hundreds of new items, objects, weapons, armour pieces and much more! All races have their own crafting progression, unique weapons and tiered armour, randomly generated settlements and anything else you'd expect from a new Starbound race. Quality is extremely important to me, and so the mod is incredibly polished, and everything you find in this mod will feel like a natural part of the game.\n\n\n=======================================\nNEW RACES\n=======================================\nThe three new races added by this mod are:\n\n-The AVIKAN: A race of nomadic reptilian creatures from the desert planet of Kadavan. Forced to flee their homeplanet after invasions by the Theleans, they roam the galaxy in a massive fleet called the Avikan Nomada. Traditional Avikan equipment is made of bone, and when playing as an Avikan, you'll progress through the game by hunting down monsters and collecting their bones and hides. In later stages of the game, you will progress to equipment made of a unique metal, and will gain access to a varied assortment of weaponsand equipment.\n\n-The DRODEN: A race of robotic servants created by the Avikan during their war with the Theleans. They come in two variations: War Frames and Utility Frames, represented in-game by their gender. While the majority of Droden are mindless droids, some are fully evolved AIs which rival even the Glitch. The Droden, being creations of the Avikan, share the majority of content with the Avikan, but they do come with their own tired armour, and can craft a few unique racial weapons later in the game.\n\n-The TRINK: A race of sentient robotic beings created by the Notix, a race living on the frozen planet called Icicle. They are famous for their incredible intelligence, and value efficiency aboe all, making them some of the best engineers in the galaxy. They craft their equipment from a variety of unique, extra-strong metals, and favour electric pords and laser rifles in combat. They are unlike any other race in the game, offering a truly unique gameplay experience.\n\n\n=======================================\nADDITIONAL CONTENT\n=======================================\nBesides the three new playable races, the mod adds a massive amount of new content to the game, which you can enjoy even when not playing as one of the Elithian races. Here's a small selection of the vast amount of content available:\n\n-Hundreds of new, racially-themed decorative objects\n-New crafting tables, and dozens of new crafting materials for all races\n-Dozens of new weapons, and multiple new weapon archetypes for you to find and craft\n-Dozens of racially-themed armour sets, both functional and decorative\n-Settlements and random encounters for all races, filled with lively NPCs\n-A new outpost, the Starfarer's Refuge, complete with merchants, services and quests\n-Codex entries on the lore behind the various races, including a make-over of the Codex menu\n-Ancient ruins left behind by a powerful race that has long since vanished from the universe\n-Several new monsters to fight, capture and collect\n-New crops to harvest, and food items to prepare\n-A new rarity for items and equipment, Unique, for items of an even higher quality than Legendary\n-Unique Weapons with firing modes and other characteristics which set them apart from anything you can find in the base game\n-Unique SAIL sprites for each of the races\n-Custom respawn animations for all races\n-New vehicles for you to obtain, including hoverbikes and a mount\n-A new sub-biome for desert planets, including a new quicksand liquid and unique monsters\n-Custom crewmembers for you to recruit\n\nAnd much, much more besides!\n\n\n=======================================\nFAQ\n=======================================\nQ: Where is the option to create an Avikan, or one of the other custom races?\nA: You'll need a Character Creation Extender mod to play as custom races. Any will do, but I recommend using one that adds a large number of new slots.\n\nQ: What are the blacked-out creatures on the mod banner?\nA: They are previews for the other races that I am planning to add: in total, at least ten species are planned for inclusion in the mod, and that is excluding bonus races such as the Droden! Adding more races takes much time, so it will be some time before all races get added, but more races are definitely on the way!\n\nQ: What is the Elithian Alliance?\nA: The Elithian Alliance was a forum-based roleplay, which started on the Spore forums years ago, then migrated to its own website. All races and all lore from the mod are part of the fictional universe created for this roleplay. The roleplay lasted for several years, so the lore is plentiful and detailed! The Elithian Alliance itself is an alliance between a multitude of interstellar nations, the headquarters of which stands on Elithia: the planet where the Alliance was first created.\n\nQ: Where can I find Unique Weapons?\nA: Unique Weapons are found as quest rewards, or as random loot from Sealed Caches. Sealed Caches can be found in Avikan and Centensian containers, or can be received as quest rewards or tenant gifts. Each race also has a unique, racially-exclusive Unique Weapon, which you can obtain as a quest reward after finishing the Glitch mission.\n\nQ: I want to craft items and objects specific to a certain race, but I don't want to play as that race myself. How do I do this?\nA: You can find a black market vendor, the Drifter's Emporium, in the upper levels of the Starfarer's Refuge. The black market is hidden from plain sight, so get exploring! Once you've find it, you can purchase Crafting Guides from the black market, which teach you all of the racial crafting blueprints, regardless of your own race.\n\nQ: Where do I find the Starfarer's Refuge?\nA: There is a teleporter in every Avikan settlement that links directly to the Starfarer's Refuge. Once you're there, you can bookmark the teleporter at the Translocator Store for quick and easy access!\n\nQ: Where do I find the new settlements?\nA: Settlements for each race can be found on planets with climates that are favoured by that race. For example, Avikan settlements are found on desert and arid planets, while Trinkian settlements are found on snow and frozen planets.",
