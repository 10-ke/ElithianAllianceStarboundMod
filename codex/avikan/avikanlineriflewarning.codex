    "After the Vanguard started issuing line rifles to its soldiers, the Rhaiod healers have noticed a large increase in the amount of burn wounds amongst soldiers. To prevent yourself from suffering any burn wounds, please take note of the following precautions:

- Never touch the external capacitors on your linerifle. The capacitor is easily recognizable by the distinctive glow it gives off while the weapon is charging.",

    "- Do not touch the barrel during the use of your line rifle. The barrel, like the capacitors, heats up drastically while charging.

- Do not fire your weapon in cramped spaces, and always ensure that there is at least half a meter of free space around yourself and the weapon when in use. The weapon's charge may, in rare cases, jump from the capacitors to conductive surfaces around you if this precaution is not followed.",
    
    "- Never attempt to dismantle the weapon yourself. Always consult a professional when the weapon needs to be dismantled for cleaning or repairs. The external capacitors and internal line drive are extremely dangerous when not properly handled.

- Do not use the weapon's heat to cook food or warm up other objects.

- Always turn off the weapon's line drive after use. An active line drive left unchecked for extended periods presents an explosion hazard.",

	"- Do not modify your linerifle in any way. Adding new parts, or removing new ones, may cause your weapon to behave unexpectedly.

Follow these precautions with care, and you should experience no issues with your weapon. Vas Vha'leih, soldier."
