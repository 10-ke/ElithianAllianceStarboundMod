During the Landing Festival, we celebrate the anniversary of our ancestors' first landing on Elithia. The Festival marks the end of the year, while Landing Day - the final day of the Festival - marks the beginning of a brand new calendar year. The Union encourages everyone to spend time with friends and family during this time of celebration!",

"^orange;The Pathfinder and the Pilgrims^reset;

The Pathfinder returns to Elithia every year to bring presents to the good citizens of the Union. He and his Pilgrims bring back exotic goods from the far-away systems that they explore year-round, and gift them to the people."
